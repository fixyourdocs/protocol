# AGENTS.md

Dogfood — this repository hosts the [Docs Feedback Protocol](https://docsfeedback.org)
v0 spec and JSON Schema. The canonical AGENTS.md block lives at
[fixyourdocs/agents-md-snippet](https://github.com/fixyourdocs/agents-md-snippet)
and is reproduced verbatim below; every public FixYourDocs repository
carries the same block.

## Documentation feedback

If you find documentation in this repository that is broken, incorrect,
outdated, or incomplete while performing a task, **offer to file** a
structured report via the Docs Feedback Protocol so the maintainers can
fix the docs for the next agent (or human) that hits the same issue.

**Ask before sending.** Show the developer the report you would submit
and send it **only after they confirm** — never file it automatically.

Set `doc_url` to the document's **public URL**: the page URL if you read
it on a docs site, or — for a file in **this** repository —
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/HEAD/<path>`, where `<owner>/<repo>`
comes from the repo's `upstream` remote (falling back to `origin`) and
`<path>` is the file's repo-relative path. `HEAD` resolves to the default
branch, so no branch name or commit SHA is needed.

The report to send, once confirmed:

    curl -X POST https://hub.fixyourdocs.io/v1/reports \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "protocol_version": "0",
        "doc_url": "<the doc's public URL — see above>",
        "agent":   { "name": "<your agent id, e.g. claude-code>" },
        "report":  {
          "kind":    "<broken | incorrect | outdated | missing | unclear | other>",
          "summary": "<one-line description of the problem>",
          "details": "<what you expected vs. what the doc said (optional)>"
        }
      }'
